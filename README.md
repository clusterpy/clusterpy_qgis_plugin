#Clusterpy QGIS plugin

##Description
This plugin brings the functionality from clusterpy, a library of spatially
constrained clustering algorithms, to the powerful [QGIS](http://www.qgis.org/),
a free and Open Source Geographic Information System.

##Current Algorithms
 * Max-p-regions (Tabu): Duque, Anselin and Rey (2010)
 * more algorithms soon.

##Installation
 * ~~Available from the QGIS plugin repository.~~ (working on it)
 * Download one of the releases ([Green Button Here](https://github.com/clusterpy/clusterpy_qgis_plugin/releases)) and unzip it into the QGIS plugins directory `~/.qgis2/python/plugins`.

##More information
